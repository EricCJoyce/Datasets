## International Draughts Transcripts

One uncommented line is one match. Moves follow the notation illustrated in REF.png. Moves alternate sides and are separated by spaces. Move indices are separated by hyphens. Match results are separated from their move sequences by a tab. 1/2-1/2 means the game ended in a draw. 1-0 means light (side to move first) won. 0-1 means dark won.

`tdl.txt` was generated during TD(lambda) training.

However your deep learning project interprets the board, you can use these records to train a value or a policy network.
