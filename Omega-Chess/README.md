## Transcripts generated by Monte Carlo tree search

Omega Chess was invented by [Daniel MacDonald](https://omegachess.com/).

One uncommented line is one match. Moves follow the notation illustrated in REF.png. Moves alternate sides and are separated by spaces. Move indices are separated by hyphens. Pawn promotions are tripartite, with uppercase symbols for white and lowercase symbols for black, e.g. 113-125-Q. Castling is identified by king moves of more than one square, e.g. 18-20 for white kingside. Match results are separated from their move sequences by a tab. 1/2-1/2 means the game ended in a draw. 1-0 means white (side to move first) won. 0-1 means black won.

However your deep learning project interprets the board, you can use these records to train a value or a policy network.
