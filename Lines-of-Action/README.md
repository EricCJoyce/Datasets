## Transcripts generated by Monte Carlo tree search

One uncommented line is one match. Moves follow the notation illustrated in REF.png. Moves alternate sides and are separated by spaces. Move indices are separated by hyphens. Match results are separated from their move sequences by a tab. 1/2-1/2 means the game ended in a draw. 1-0 means black (side to move first) won. 0-1 means white won.

However your deep learning project interprets the board, you can use these records to train a value or a policy network.
