## Lines of Action transcripts

For all documents, one uncommented line is one match. Moves follow the notation illustrated in REF.png. Moves alternate sides and are separated by spaces. Move indices are separated by hyphens. Match results are separated from their move sequences by a tab. 1/2-1/2 means the game ended in a draw. 1-0 means black (side to move first) won. 0-1 means white won.
